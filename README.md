# Cornell tutorials

Much of the Sethupathy bioinformatic analyses rely on a core set of piplines, and thus, knowing how to execute these bioinformatic pipelines on the Cornell computing infrastructure (CBSU) is key to completing the bioinformatic portion of a project. To this end, instructions on how to run these pipelines has been compiled. The tutorials instructions are here and the associated files can be found on the Cornell cluster here:
