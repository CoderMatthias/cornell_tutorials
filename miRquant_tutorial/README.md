# Cornell specific miRquant instructions

Instructions on running miRhub using the python wrapper for Jeanette's perl code.

The location of the miRhub tutorial is here:
```
/home/pr46_0001/cornell_tutorials/miRquant_tutorial/
```

The directory contents are:
```
$ ls -1
bin
cornell_mirquantENV.sh
final_processing.py
miRquant.py
process_summary_to_tab.py
README.md
runC.py
test_multi_samples
test_sample
```

`test_sample` is a good place to start to practice running the first three major chunks of miRquant in a short amount of time, but ultimately we want to run `test_multi_samples`, which will teach you the full miRquant analysis on muliple samples of various conditions.

We'll next reserve a machine, login to our machine, create a folder in the working directory, and move our test files there. For information on this, see [getting ready to run a job](https://github.com/Sethupathy-Lab/cornell_tutorials/blob/master/getting_ready_to_run_a_job.md).

Copy our test files to Cornell ID work directory.
```
$ cp /home/pr46_0001/cornell_tutorials/miRquant_tutorial/test_multi_samples/* /workdir/<your Cornell ID here>/
$ cd /workdir/<your Cornell ID here>/
```

Change to your Cornell ID working directory and edit the file within the configuration directory (conf_miRquant.yml). The project path must match where your fastqs are and the output path must be identical until the naming of the directory to hold the output. This will require you to replace **``<put your Cornell ID here>``** with your Cornell ID. The path section of conf_miRquant.yml looks like this:
```
# Directory locations
paths:
    genome:
        /home/pr46_0001/projects/genome/
    mirquant:
        /home/pr46_0001/cornell_tutorials/cornell_miRquant_tutorial/
    output:
        /workdir/<put your Cornell ID here>/test_multi_samples/tutorial_output/
    project:
        /workdir/<put your Cornell ID here>/test_multi_samples/
```
