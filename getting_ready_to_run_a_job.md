# Running a job on the Cornell clusters

We need to first need to reserve a machine to run our job on cbsu. Information on getting an account, logining on to CBSU, and reserving machines can be found in the [CBSU quickstart guide](https://cbsu.tc.cornell.edu/lab/userguide.aspx?a=quickstart). Once you are logged into your reserved machine, change to the work directory and create a directory with your Cornell user id.

```
$ cd /workdir/
$ mkdir <Cornell user ID here>
```

Whenever we are running jobs, we will have to transfer our files to that location and run everything from there.
